# Auctionable Change [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change_api)

## Description

**Auctionable Change** is a cross-pollination capstone project for [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

The idea behind **A.change** is creating a platform where individuals can post items they no longer want or need for sale/auction. 
Sellers set a minimum price and select a charity to which the funds from that item's sale would be donated. Buyers browse items and purchase by donating to charity. 
Buyers notify sellers through app generated email with proof of donation and shipping information.
