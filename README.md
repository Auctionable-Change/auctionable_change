### Together we can make **A.change**! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Auctionable-Change/auctionable_change)

##  Description
**Auctionable Change** is a cross-pollination capstone project for [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).
The idea behind **A.change** is supporting charities and the planet by reselling items and buying secondhand.
Sellers can post items, set a minimum price and select a charity to which the funds from that item's sale will be donated. 
Buyers browse items and purchase by donating to selected charity. 
Buyers notify sellers through app generated email with proof of donation and shipping information.

- Filter by location will let users save on shipping by picking up or dropping off local items
